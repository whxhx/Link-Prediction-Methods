=== ABOUT ===

This folder contains the raw graph datasets in Matlab format.

For each data set X, the Matlab command
  load X
loads into the memory a struct array containing graphs, and a column vector lx containing 
a class label for each graph.
X(i).am is the adjacency matrix of the i'th graph (has been transformed to full format using utils/sparse2full.m);
X(i).al is the adjacency list of the i'th graph;
X(i).nl.values is a column vector of node labels for the i'th graph;
X(i).el (not always available) contains edge labels for the i'th graph.

Example: 
typing "load MUTAG" in MATLAB
loads a 188 element array of graph structures, called MUTAG, and a column of 188 numbers, 
each of which indicates the class that the corresponding graph belongs to.
