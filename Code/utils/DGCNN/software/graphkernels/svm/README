runmultiplesvm - cross-validate over different kernels and the parameter C of SVM and repeat the experiment n times with different folds. 
                 This is used with the output of all WL* scripts in the folder "labeled" - a cell array of kernel matrices. To be able 
                 to use it, you have to replace "~/code/libsvm" in runsvm.m by the name of the folder where you put the compiled mex files 
                 (svmtrain and svmpredict) of the libSVM Matlab interface.

runntimes      - cross-validate over the parameter C of SVM and repeat the experiment n times with different folds.
                 This is used with a single kernel matrix. To be able to use it, you have to replace "~/code/libsvm" 
                 in runIndependent.m by the name of the folder where you put the compiled mex files 
                 (svmtrain and svmpredict) of the libSVM Matlab interface.

To obtain information on input and output, run "help runmultiplesvm" and "help runntimes" respectively.
