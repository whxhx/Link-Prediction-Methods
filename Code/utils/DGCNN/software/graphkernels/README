This folder contains Matlab scripts for computing several graph kernels for graphs with unlabeled or 
categorically labeled nodes and scripts for evaluating the SVM classification performance using 
precomputed kernels using cross-validation.

The folder "unlabeled" contains
- a README
- the family of graphlet kernels (subfolders allgraphlets, connectedgraphlets, samplinggraphlets) from [6]
- the random walk kernel (RWkernel.m) from [7]
- the shortest path kernel (SPkernel.m) from [1]
for unlabeled graphs.

The folder "labeled" contains
- a README
- 3 kernels from the Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel family: the WL subtree (WL.m), the WL shortest path (WLspdelta.m), 
  and the WL edge (WLedge.m) kernels from [5]
- the labeled 3-node graphlet kernel (l3graphletkernel.m) - extension of an algorithm in [6]
- the labeled random walk kernel (lRWkernel.m) from [7]
- the labeled random walk kernel based on walks up to size p (untilpRWkernel.m) - extension of [2],[3]
- the labeled shortest path kernel (spkernel.m) from [1]
- the Ramon and Gaertner subtree kernel (RGkernel.m) from [4]
for graphs with categorically labeled nodes. Note that all WL kernels in this folder also support unlabeled 
graphs.

"help X.m" executed in Matlab will display instructions on the usage of X.m for any script X.m

MUTAG is an example graph data set in the required format for all scripts above.

The folder "svm" contains scripts for evaluating the classification performance of SVM with precomputed kernels 
using cross-validation. It also contains a separate README. You need to install libSVM and its Matlab interface 
to be able to use scripts in this folder.
