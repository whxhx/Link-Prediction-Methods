=== Introduction ===

This folder contains Matlab scripts: WL.m, WLedge.m, WLspdelta.m,
RGkernel.m, l3graphletkernel.m. lRWkernel.m, untilpRWkernel.m, spkernel.m

WL.m computes the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel
WLedge.m computes the Weisfeiler-Lehman edge kernel
WLspdelta.m computes the Weisfeiler-Lehman shortest path kernel (with 
exact matching of shortest path lengths)
on graphs with unweighted unlabeled edges, with/without discrete node labels.

RGkernel.m - Ramon and Gaertner subtree kernel
l3graphletkernel.m - labeled 3-node graphlet kernel
lRWkernel.m - labeled random walk kernel
untilpRWkernel.m - labeled random walk kernel up to p-step random walks
spkernel.m - labeled shortest path kernel (with delta kernel on shortest path lengths)


=== Usage ===

For each script X.m, the Matlab command
  help X
will display instructions on how to use the script X.m
