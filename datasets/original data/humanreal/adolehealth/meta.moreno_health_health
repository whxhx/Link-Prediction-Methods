long-description: This directed network was created from a survey that took place in 1994/1995. Each student was asked to list his 5 best female and his 5 male friends. A node represents a student and an edge between two students shows that the left student chose the right student as a friend. Higher edge weights indicate more interactions and a edge weight shows that there is no common activity at all.
